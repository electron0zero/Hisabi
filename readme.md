## Hisabi
Application to calculate Area of land based on Traditional Indian Land Measurements System Known As [Bigha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigha) and Biswa System

we used these units because it's standard around my place

    1 Bigha = 20 Biswa
    1 Bigha = 165*165 = 27225 sq. feet
    1 Biswa = 27225/20 = 1361.25 sq. feet

These units is used in conversion, also feet is the unit for everything in this application
